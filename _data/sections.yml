        title: Cliffs & Caves
        description: Near Lagos, you’ll find the Ponta da Piedade, a golden promontory that juts into the sea. The chain of cliffs is best explored by boat, where the unusual forms of the rock create caves, pillars and enchanting grottos. Further along the coast, the famous Benagil cave is a remarkable swimming spot, with an impressive natural cupola open at its peak streaming lightbeaches onto the sheltered beach below. Buy a lilo and sling your stuff on it, swimming around to this hidden, mesmerising spot.

        title: Coastal Towns
        description: The towns that dot the coastline of the Algarve are, naturally, perfect places to set up shop whilst discovering this gorgeous region. Expect Moorish ruins and foodie treats in Aljezur, or enjoy the wonderfully traditional Tavira, decked with medieval touches and cool, whitewashed piazzas. However, if you’re looking for something far from the tourist path, Cacela Velha is possibly the quaintest of all the Algarve’s coastal retreats. It’s tiny, traditional, picturesque and a true Algarvian idyll.

        title: Beaches
        description: The beaches here are some of the finest in Europe. The water, azure blue, the sands golden. And this is what you’re really here for, is it not? Praia da Marinha is a gorgeous beach, backed by cliffs and falling into crystal-clear waters. Explore the sea caves or kick-back in peace; the beach is quiet, only accessible by lengthy cliff stairs. Praia do Ancão is where the locals go, secluded yet close enough to bars and cafes. But for true peace seekers make for Praia da Barreta; only accessible by boat, this lengthy spit of beach is disconnected from the mainland. Paradise!

      - id: ria-formosa
        title: Ria Formosa
        description: This remarkable wetland of lagoons and small island spits is a natural treasure. Migratory birds depend on this unique landscape, making the wetlands perfect for birdwatching. A picture of blue and green, boat tours frequently criss-cross through the lengthy island network, so pick your tour and discover the Algarve’s most coveted natural prize.

        title: Alte
        description: In the rolling interior of the region, picturesque villages and small towns cling to rocky outcrops, warrens of rural life ripe for exploration. The cobbled, whitewashed town of Alte is refreshingly pretty. Winding lanes connect small artisan craft shops, cafes and restaurants, with fontes (small streams that once fed the mills) spread throughout. The Grand Font is perfect for a refreshing dip – just as the locals do.

        description: Head for the town of Monchique, a quaint spot hidden amongst the eponymous forested mountains. As you head up the steep cobbled lanes, follow signs for ‘Convento’. The road soon disappears as the path winds upward through forested slopes, an enchanting setting backdropped with excellent views over the town and valley. Soon, you’ll reach the crumbling edifice of the old convent. It’s a hauntingly beautiful place, hiding on the hillside...

        description: This long trail, an old pilgrim route, stretches from one end of the Algarve to the other. It snakes over mountain valleys, thick forests and wetlands. Pick your stretch and discover the natural beauty of the region, passing quaint villages and towns steeped in history and brimming with culture. Cross over the Serra do Caldeirão, make for the Serra de Monchique, or head straight to the finishing line; the cliff edges of the Promontory of Sagres. Each walk or hike promises inspired sights.

        title: Loulé
        description: The largest inland town, Loulé is a great jumping off point for exploring the Algarve’s mountains and hidden villages. Its markets are great for stocking up on supplies, its cafes and restaurants great for indulging in southern Portugal’s delicacies. The dominating Moorish castle and surrounding old quarter are a charming setting, hiding age-old artisan workshops. Tradition runs deep; the town’s history stretches back to the Romans.

        description: This bustling town, where the Algarve’s heritage is written into the architecture and style of the place, shelters a beautiful Old Town. Roman and Moorish landmarks fall around, with high curtain walls enclosing the medieval alleyways. Islamic curves sit next to Italianate piazzas, where cafe culture thrives and the restaurants excel in Algarvian offerings. Do as the Algarvians do; find a spot for people watching over coffee and nibbles in this gorgeous locale.

        title: Silves
        description: You’ll know you’ve reached the quiet town of Silves – the red-stone castle dominates the hilltop, with the old town falling down the slopes. It’s an impressive Moorish fortification, worth a closer look; plus, overlooking the towering walls offers great views over the town’s pretty terracotta rooftops. Wander the old town and make for the indoor market, listening in on the frantic haggling and bagging some regional treats. The wider Silves region is also home to plenty of wineries, so be sure to pitch-up al fresco with a glass.

        title: Sacred Art
        description: The Algarve remains a spiritual place and nowhere is this more evident than in the devotion shown to the churches across the region. Their humble, whitewashed exteriors create an almost comical juxtaposition to their breathtakingly ornate interiors. Take São Lourenço; past the plain facade hides an evocative blue and white marvel, an intricately-tiled interior so punchy you’ll miss a breath. Azelujo tiles create a powerful performance. Such intricacy is also found in the gilded confines of Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Carmo; but the morbid highlight is the carefully-decorated bone chapel at its rear, the Capela dos Ossos.

      - id: gypsy-markets
        title: Gypsy markets
        description: The region’s gypsy markets, or flea markets, are a great place to get down with locals. Study carefully; haggling is a rite of passage! Find vintage gems and artisanal treats – most will have a smattering of local craftspeople and foodie producers sharing their wares. Make for Loulé on Saturdays (next to the food market!), or head for the monthly market at Lagoa. There’s more across the region to suit any visit, so brush up on your Portuguese bargaining skills and find your treasures!

        description: It’s no surprise that the Algarve is a seafood lover’s paradise. Fresh fish is the mainstay of the Algarve kitchen – it doesn’t come much fresher. Local favourites include grilled sardines and the regional classic, cataplana. Lobster, clams, squid and whatever else looks good is hauled from the sea and cooked in white wine and tomato, in an eponymous copper dish. Delicious!

        description: It’s evident that Algarvians have perfected their sweet-tooth smorgasbord. Doces finos – colourful marzipan shapes filled with sweet egg cream, morgadinho – a round, white ball of delicate delight, and the rather unique, silver-wrapped Dom Rodrigo – sweet egg threads and sweet egg cream flavoured with cinnamon. Finish it off with a tipple of medronho, an arbutus-berry brandy.
